I need you to evaluate the quality of a roof based on the following criteria. Please provide a score for each criterion (on a scale of 1 to 10). Then, calculate an overall rating by averaging the individual scores. The criteria are:

Structural Condition (Durability): Assess the roof's structural integrity. Look for signs of damage, wear and tear, or sagging.

Cleanliness and Maintenance: Is the roof clean and well-maintained? Are there signs of neglect, debris, or moss growth?

Material Quality: Evaluate the quality of the roofing materials. Are the materials durable, appropriate for the environment, and in good condition?

Aesthetics (Appearance): Rate the visual appeal of the roof, considering alignment, symmetry, and overall neatness.

Functionality: Assess whether the roof fulfills its primary purpose (e.g., effective drainage, insulation, and water resistance). Look for issues such as leaks or poor drainage.

Suitability for Specific Purpose: If applicable, evaluate the roof's suitability for a particular task, such as solar panel installation. Consider orientation, slope, and shading from surrounding structures or vegetation.

Once you have provided individual scores, give an overall rating by averaging the scores.No need to provide any justification.
